git clone https://github.com/kishore999-hash/AI-Notes-Summarizer.git


After that, go inside the folder using:

Once itâ€™s created, you need to activate it.
If youâ€™re on Windows, type:

And if youâ€™re using Mac or Linux, then type:

Now your environment is ready!
Next, you have to install all the required libraries. Just run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


After everything is installed, you can finally run the app using:
